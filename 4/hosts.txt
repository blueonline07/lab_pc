# MPI hosts file for multi-host execution
# Format: hostname slots=N
# Each line specifies a host and the number of slots (processes) it can run

# For local testing (single machine)
localhost slots=8

# For multi-host setup (uncomment and modify for actual cluster):
# mpi-host-1 slots=4
# mpi-host-2 slots=4
# mpi-host-3 slots=4
